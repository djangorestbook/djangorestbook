Collaborative book on Django Rest Framework

## Introduction

The idea of writing a book about Django Rest Framework comes from my (Andrea Grandi)
daily usage of this fantastic library. The framework itself has a very good documentation but sometimes it can be not enough, expecially for people that have
just started working with it.

I don't define myself a Django Rest Framework expert despite having used it for
the latest 2 years and very often I need to look at the documentation. This is why
I would like to make this a collaborative work: I have surely the willing but not all the required experience.

Surely at the end of this adventure I (and everyone who will contribute) will have
a wider knowledge of the framework, but still the book will need the help of more people expecially in areas where an expert of internals is required or even just to review how it has been written (disclaimer: I'm not a native english speaker, so expect some errors in the text).

## Summary

* Chapter 1: Introduction to Django Rest Framework
* Chapter 2: Getting Started
* Chapter 3: chapter 3 title
* ...

## Contribute

There are many things that can be done at this stage:

* Coordinating the contributions
* Writing chapters
* Reviewing what has been written and fixing errors

When the book will be ready it mostly depends on how many people will contribute and how much time I will be able to dedicate to this side (I have a full time job) project.
