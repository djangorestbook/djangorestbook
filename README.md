Collaborative book on Django Rest Framework

## Introduction

The idea of writing a book about the Django Rest Framework comes from my (Andrea Grandi)
daily usage of this fantastic library. The framework has good documentation already, but could be made more accessible to new users.

Although I've been using the framework for the last 2 years, I don't consider myself an expert and still use the documentation fairly frequently. This is why I would like to collaborate with others and for those who may be more experienced with the framework to contribute.

I expect that by writing this book we all will have a better understanding of the Django Rest Framework and also will have produced a good starting point for new users.

Disclaimer: I'm not a native English speaker, so expect some errors in the text.

## Summary

## Contribute

There are many things that can be done at this stage:

* Coordinating the contributions
* Writing chapters
* Reviewing what has been written and fixing errors

The speed and frequency of new chapters being added is dependant on how many people contribute and also how much time I'll be able to spend on it (I have a full time job).
